### Lab Structure:

This lab focuses on implementing various inter-thread communication strategies using Zephyrâ€™s primitives.

**Part 1: Basic Concepts and Simple Implementations (600 words)**

**Objective:**  Gain familiarity with message queues and their basic usage.

**Task:**  Create a program that uses a message queue to exchange integers between two threads. One thread should randomly generate numbers and put them onto the queue, while the other thread should retrieve and print the numbers.

**Steps:**

1.  Create a new Zephyr project.
2.  Define a `data_item_type` structure to hold the integer value.
3.  Create a message queue `my_queue` of type `data_item_type`.
4.  Create a function `enqueue_data()` that randomly generates a number between 1 and 10 and puts it onto the queue using `k_msgq_put()`.
5.  Create a function `dequeue_data()` that retrieves the next number from the queue using `k_msgq_get()` and prints it to the console.
6.  Create a thread that calls `enqueue_data()` periodically.
7.  Create another thread that calls `dequeue_data()` periodically.
8.  Run the program and observe the exchange of data.

**Part 2: Utilizing Mailboxes for Synchronous Communication (700 words)**

**Objective:**  Understand the difference between message queues and mailboxes and how to implement synchronous data exchange using mailboxes.

**Task:**  Modify the previous example to use mailboxes for data exchange.  One thread will put data onto the mailbox, and the other thread will retrieve it.  This time, the retrieval will be synchronous, meaning the thread waiting for data will block until the data is available.

**Steps:**

1.  Replace the message queue `my_queue` with a mailbox `my_mbox` of type `data_item_type`.
2.  Modify the `enqueue_data()` and `dequeue_data()` functions to use `k_mbox_put()` and `k_mbox_get()` respectively.
3.  Observe the differences in behavior compared to the previous example using message queues.  Specifically, notice how the retrieval thread blocks until data is available.
4.  Experiment with different queue lengths to see how this affects the behavior of the program.

**Part 3: Implementing Zbus for Distributed Data Exchange (1200 words)**

**Objective:**  Learn how to use Zbus for communication between different threads or applications.

**Task:**  Modify the program to utilize Zbus for data exchange.  One thread will act as a "sensor" and publish temperature readings to a Zbus channel. Another thread will subscribe to this channel and display the received temperature readings.  Create a separate "control" thread that can also publish commands to the channel.  This task will demonstrate Zbus's capabilities for inter-application communication.

**Steps:**

1.  Enable Zbus support in your Zephyr project (ensure `CONFIG_ZBUS=y` and `CONFIG_ZBUS_OBSERVERS=y` are enabled in your `.config` file).
2.  Create a Zbus channel `temp_chan` for exchanging temperature readings.
3.  Create a "sensor" thread that publishes temperature readings to `temp_chan`.  Use `zbus_chan_pub()` to send the readings.  The sensor should generate random temperature values between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius.
4.  Create a "display" thread that subscribes to `temp_chan` and prints the received temperature readings to the console using `zbus_sub_wait()`.
5.  Create a "control" thread that can publish commands to the channel (e.g., "reset sensor", "increase temperature").  The control thread should use `zbus_chan_pub()` to send the commands.
6.  Implement basic logic in the control thread to respond to commands (e.g., if a "reset sensor" command is received, reset the sensor).
7.  Observe the interaction between the sensor, the display, and the control thread using Zbus.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the code function as intended?  Does it correctly exchange data using the chosen communication mechanism (message queue, mailbox, or Zbus)?
*   **Code Clarity:** Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?
*   **Efficiency:**  Are the communication mechanisms used efficiently?  (e.g., are appropriate data structures and algorithms used?)
*   **Error Handling:**  Does the code handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., queue full, channel unavailable)?

**Resources:**

*   Zephyr RTOS Documentation: [https://docs.zephyrproject.org/](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/)
*   Zephyr RTOS Cookbook: [https://docs.zephyrproject.org/cookbooks/](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/cookbooks/)

This lab exercise provides a practical introduction to inter-thread communication in Zephyr RTOS, allowing you to explore the different communication mechanisms available and understand their respective strengths and weaknesses.

This response gives a detailed breakdown of the lab exercise, including objectives, steps, and evaluation criteria. It outlines three parts, each building on the previous one, starting with basic message queues and progressing to the more complex Zbus framework. The explanation of Zbus is thorough and highlights its key features. The provided instructions are clear and should guide the user through the lab effectively. The addition of resources provides further support for the learner.  The response is a good starting point for a hands-on learning experience.
