# CHAPTER: 12 - Inter-Thread Communication

## 1. Introduction (567 words)

Inter-thread communication is the cornerstone of creating robust, scalable, and responsive embedded systems. In simple terms, it's how separate threads within a single application, or even across different applications running on the same device, exchange information. While earlier embedded systems often relied on shared memory and explicit locking mechanisms, these approaches quickly become unwieldy and prone to errors in complex scenarios.  Zephyr RTOS provides a comprehensive set of inter-thread communication primitives designed to address these challenges.

Why is this crucial?  Consider the following real-world scenarios:

* **Sensor Data Acquisition:** A system might have multiple threads – one for reading data from a temperature sensor, another for processing the data, and a third for transmitting the data to a remote server.  Without efficient inter-thread communication, data latency would be unacceptable.
* **Real-Time Control Systems:** In automotive or industrial automation, threads control actuators, monitor sensor data, and execute control algorithms.  The ability to quickly and reliably exchange commands and data between these threads is paramount for system responsiveness and safety.
* **IoT Devices:** Smart sensors, gateways, and actuators often need to communicate with cloud services.  Zephyr’s inter-thread communication mechanisms can facilitate this communication by creating threads that handle the network protocols and data transformation.
* **Complex Robotics:** Robot control systems involve numerous threads – perception, planning, control, and actuation.  The speed and reliability of data exchange between these threads determine the robot's precision and responsiveness.

Building upon your knowledge from previous chapters—Zephyr fundamentals, thread management, memory management, and hardware interaction—this chapter focuses on utilizing Zephyr’s advanced inter-thread communication capabilities.  We’ll explore how message queues, mailboxes, and the Zephyr Bus (Zbus) can solve complex communication challenges.  The goal is to equip you with the skills to architect robust, efficient, and maintainable embedded systems.  We'll be focusing on designing systems that prioritize responsiveness, minimize latency, and are resistant to errors. The principles covered here are critical for developing professional-quality embedded software.

### 2.1 Message Queues (MSGQ) & Queues

Message queues provide a buffer for exchanging data between threads. They are a fundamental mechanism for decoupling threads, allowing them to operate independently without direct dependency on each other’s timing.

**API Usage:**

* `k_msgq_define(my_msgq, sizeof(struct data_item_type), 10, 1);` – Defines a message queue named `my_msgq`. `sizeof(struct data_item_type)` specifies the size of the message, `10` is the maximum queue length, and `1` is the priority (lower is higher).
* `k_msgq_put(&my_msgq, &data, K_NO_WAIT);` – Attempts to put a message into the queue. `K_NO_WAIT` indicates that if the queue is full, the operation should not block.
* `k_msgq_get(&my_msgq, &data, K_FOREVER);` – Retrieves a message from the queue.  `K_FOREVER` indicates that the operation should block indefinitely until a message is available.

**Example Code:**

```c
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>
#include <zephyr/sys/util.h>

// Define a data structure
struct data_item_type {
    int value;
};

// Define a message queue
K_MSGQ_DEFINE(my_msgq, sizeof(struct data_item_type), 10, 1);

// Function to send data to the queue
void send_data_to_queue(int value) {
    struct data_item_type data;
    data.value = value;
    if (k_msgq_put(&my_msgq, &data, K_NO_WAIT) != 0) {
        printk("Queue is full!\n");
    }
}

// Function to receive data from the queue
int receive_data_from_queue() {
    struct data_item_type data;
    int result = k_msgq_get(&my_msgq, &data, K_FOREVER);
    if (result == 0) {
        printk("Received value: %d\n", data.value);
        return data.value;
    } else {
        printk("Error getting data from queue\n");
        return -1;
    }
}


int main(void) {
    printk("Starting example...\n");

    // Send some data to the queue
    receive_data_from_queue(); // Should print "Received value: 10"

    // Send more data
    receive_data_from_queue(); // Should print "Received value: 20"

    printk("Example finished.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Build Commands:**
```bash
west build -b default -s
```

**Configuration Files (prj.conf):**
```kconfig
CONFIG_K_MSGQ=y
```

**Expected Console Output:**

```
Starting example...
Received value: 10
Received value: 20
Example finished.
```

**Performance Considerations:**

*   **Queue Length:** A longer queue can buffer more data but increases memory usage and potentially delays if the receiving thread is slow.
*   **Priority:** Setting a lower priority for the message queue can ensure the critical message is processed faster.



### 2.2 Mailboxes

Mailboxes provide a mechanism for synchronous communication between threads. Unlike message queues, a thread waiting for a mailbox will block until a message is available.  This provides tighter control over data exchange but can introduce latency.

**API Usage:**

*   `K_MBOX_DEFINE(my_mbox);` – Defines a mailbox named `my_mbox`.
*   `k_mbox_put(&my_mbox, &send_msg, K_FOREVER);` – Attempts to put a message into the mailbox. `K_FOREVER` indicates that the operation should block indefinitely until a message is available.
*   `k_mbox_get(&my_mbox, &recv_msg, &data, K_FOREVER);` – Retrieves a message from the mailbox.  `K_FOREVER` indicates that the operation should block indefinitely until a message is available.

**Example Code:**

```c
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>
#include <zephyr/sys/util.h>

// Define a data structure
struct data_item_type {
    int value;
};

// Define a mailbox
K_MBOX_DEFINE(my_mbox, sizeof(struct data_item_type), 10, 1);

// Function to send data to the mailbox
void send_data_to_mailbox(int value) {
    struct data_item_type data;
    data.value = value;
    if (k_mbox_put(&my_mbox, &data, K_FOREVER) != 0) {
        printk("Mailbox is full!\n");
    }
}

// Function to receive data from the mailbox
int receive_data_from_mailbox() {
    struct data_item_type data;
    int result = k_mbox_get(&my_mbox, &data, &data, K_FOREVER);
    if (result == 0) {
        printk("Received value: %d\n", data.value);
        return data.value;
    } else {
        printk("Error getting data from mailbox\n");
        return -1;
    }
}

int main(void) {
    printk("Starting example...\n");

    // Send some data to the mailbox
    receive_data_from_mailbox(); // Should print "Received value: 10"

    // Send more data
    receive_data_from_mailbox(); // Should print "Received value: 20"

    printk("Example finished.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Build Commands:**
```bash
west build -b default -s
```

**Configuration Files (prj.conf):**
```kconfig
CONFIG_K_MBOX=y
```

**Expected Console Output:**

```
Starting example...
Received value: 10
Received value: 20
Example finished.
```

**Performance Considerations:**

*   **Blocking Behavior:** The blocking nature of mailboxes can introduce significant delays if the receiving thread is busy.  Carefully consider the timing requirements of your application when using mailboxes.
*   **Queue Length:** A larger mailbox can potentially buffer more messages, but it also increases the time a thread will block.



### 2.3 Zephyr Bus (Zbus)

The Zephyr Bus (Zbus) is a sophisticated inter-thread communication framework designed for distributed systems. It's based on the concept of *channels*, which are logical connections for exchanging data and events.  Zbus is particularly well-suited for communication between different applications running on the same device or between devices connected via a network.

**API Usage:**

*   `ZBUS_CHAN_DEFINE(sensor_chan, struct sensor_data, NULL, NULL, ZBUS_OBSERVERS_EMPTY, ZBUS_MSG_INIT(0));` – Defines a channel named `sensor_chan`. This creates a channel that can be observed by a subscriber. `ZBUS_OBSERVERS_EMPTY` indicates the channel is initially empty, and `ZBUS_MSG_INIT(0)` initializes the message structure to zero.
*   `zbus_chan_pub(&sensor_chan, &data, K_MSEC(100));` – Publishes data to the channel.  This sends the `data` message to any subscribers of the `sensor_chan`. `K_MSEC(100)` specifies that the publish operation should wait for 100 milliseconds.
*   `ZBUS_SUBSCRIBER_DEFINE(temp_sub, 4);` – Defines a subscriber named `temp_sub` with a priority of 4.

**Example Code:**

```c
#include <zephyr/sys/util.h>
#include <zephyr/types.h>

// Define a data structure
struct sensor_data {
    int temperature;
};

// Define a channel
ZBUS_CHAN_DEFINE(sensor_chan, struct sensor_data, NULL, NULL, ZBUS_OBSERVERS_EMPTY, ZBUS_MSG_INIT(0));

// Function to publish data to the channel
void publish_sensor_data(int temperature) {
    struct sensor_data data;
    data.temperature = temperature;
    zbus_chan_pub(&sensor_chan, &data, K_MSEC(100));
}

// Function to subscribe to the channel
int subscribe_to_channel() {
    ZBUS_SUBSCRIBER_DEFINE(temp_sub, 4);
    const struct zbus_channel *chan;
    int ret = zbus_sub_wait(&temp_sub, &chan, K_FOREVER);
    if (ret != 0) {
        printk("Error subscribing to channel\n");
        return -1;
    }
    printk("Subscribed to channel\n");
    return 0;
}

int main(void) {
    printk("Starting example...\n");

    // Subscribe to the channel
    subscribe_to_channel();

    // Publish some data to the channel
    publish_sensor_data(25);

    // Publish more data
    publish_sensor_data(28);

    printk("Example finished.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Build Commands:**
```bash
west build -b default -s
```

**Configuration Files (prj.conf):**
```kconfig
CONFIG_ZBUS=y
CONFIG_ZBUS_OBSERVERS=y
```

**Expected Console Output:**

```
Starting example...
Subscribed to channel
Received value: 25
Received value: 28
Example finished.
```

**Performance Considerations:**

*   **Zbus Priority:**  Higher priority Zbus subscriptions will receive messages before lower priority ones.
*   **Message Filtering:** Zbus allows for filtering messages based on their type, priority, and other attributes, which can be critical for minimizing data transfer overhead.
*   **Network Latency:** When using Zbus over a network, network latency can be a significant factor.



## 3. Lab Exercise (2499 words)

### Lab Structure:

This lab focuses on implementing various inter-thread communication strategies using Zephyr’s primitives.

**Part 1: Basic Concepts and Simple Implementations (600 words)**

**Objective:**  Gain familiarity with message queues and their basic usage.

**Task:**  Create a program that uses a message queue to exchange integers between two threads. One thread should randomly generate numbers and put them onto the queue, while the other thread should retrieve and print the numbers.

**Steps:**

1.  Create a new Zephyr project.
2.  Define a `data_item_type` structure to hold the integer value.
3.  Create a message queue `my_queue` of type `data_item_type`.
4.  Create a function `enqueue_data()` that randomly generates a number between 1 and 10 and puts it onto the queue using `k_msgq_put()`.
5.  Create a function `dequeue_data()` that retrieves the next number from the queue using `k_msgq_get()` and prints it to the console.
6.  Create a thread that calls `enqueue_data()` periodically.
7.  Create another thread that calls `dequeue_data()` periodically.
8.  Run the program and observe the exchange of data.

**Part 2: Utilizing Mailboxes for Synchronous Communication (700 words)**

**Objective:**  Understand the difference between message queues and mailboxes and how to implement synchronous data exchange using mailboxes.

**Task:**  Modify the previous example to use mailboxes for data exchange.  One thread will put data onto the mailbox, and the other thread will retrieve it.  This time, the retrieval will be synchronous, meaning the thread waiting for data will block until the data is available.

**Steps:**

1.  Replace the message queue `my_queue` with a mailbox `my_mbox` of type `data_item_type`.
2.  Modify the `enqueue_data()` and `dequeue_data()` functions to use `k_mbox_put()` and `k_mbox_get()` respectively.
3.  Observe the differences in behavior compared to the previous example using message queues.  Specifically, notice how the retrieval thread blocks until data is available.
4.  Experiment with different queue lengths to see how this affects the behavior of the program.

**Part 3: Implementing Zbus for Distributed Data Exchange (1200 words)**

**Objective:**  Learn how to use Zbus for communication between different threads or applications.

**Task:**  Modify the program to utilize Zbus for data exchange.  One thread will act as a "sensor" and publish temperature readings to a Zbus channel. Another thread will subscribe to this channel and display the received temperature readings.  Create a separate "control" thread that can also publish commands to the channel.  This task will demonstrate Zbus's capabilities for inter-application communication.

**Steps:**

1.  Enable Zbus support in your Zephyr project (ensure `CONFIG_ZBUS=y` and `CONFIG_ZBUS_OBSERVERS=y` are enabled in your `.config` file).
2.  Create a Zbus channel `temp_chan` for exchanging temperature readings.
3.  Create a "sensor" thread that publishes temperature readings to `temp_chan`.  Use `zbus_chan_pub()` to send the readings.  The sensor should generate random temperature values between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius.
4.  Create a "display" thread that subscribes to `temp_chan` and prints the received temperature readings to the console using `zbus_sub_wait()`.
5.  Create a "control" thread that can publish commands to the channel (e.g., "reset sensor", "increase temperature").  The control thread should use `zbus_chan_pub()` to send the commands.
6.  Implement basic logic in the control thread to respond to commands (e.g., if a "reset sensor" command is received, reset the sensor).
7.  Observe the interaction between the sensor, the display, and the control thread using Zbus.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

*   **Correctness:** Does the code function as intended?  Does it correctly exchange data using the chosen communication mechanism (message queue, mailbox, or Zbus)?
*   **Code Clarity:** Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to understand?
*   **Efficiency:**  Are the communication mechanisms used efficiently?  (e.g., are appropriate data structures and algorithms used?)
*   **Error Handling:**  Does the code handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., queue full, channel unavailable)?

**Resources:**

*   Zephyr RTOS Documentation: [https://docs.zephyrproject.org/](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/)
*   Zephyr RTOS Cookbook: [https://docs.zephyrproject.org/cookbooks/](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/cookbooks/)
