# CHAPTER: 17 - Power Management

## Completing the Professional Architecture

Having mastered device driver architecture in Chapter 16—creating hardware abstraction layers that provide standardized, portable interfaces to your embedded systems—you now possess the complete technical foundation for building professional embedded software. But in today's world of IoT devices, battery-powered systems, and environmental consciousness, technical excellence alone isn't sufficient.

Modern embedded systems must also be power-efficient, extending battery life, reducing heat generation, and meeting increasingly strict environmental standards. Power management represents the final piece of professional embedded development—the expertise that transforms technically sound systems into market-viable products.

## Introduction

### Why Power Management Matters

In the realm of embedded systems, power efficiency isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a critical determinant of success.  Consider the IoT sensor node deployed in a remote agricultural environment. Its battery life dictates the duration of data collection and transmission, directly impacting the value of the insights it provides.  Similarly, in wearables, maximizing battery life is paramount for user comfort and device usability.  Even in automotive applications, where power consumption directly impacts range and operational costs, efficient power management is essential.

As systems become more complex and incorporate features like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Wi-Fi, and cellular connectivity, power consumption increases dramatically. Without careful management, batteries deplete quickly, leading to system failures and wasted resources. Zephyr RTOS provides the tools to tackle this challenge, enabling developers to create robust and reliable systems that operate efficiently and reliably on battery power.

### Real-World Scenarios & Industry Applications

* **IoT Sensors:**  Smart agriculture sensors need long battery life for unattended operation. Power management allows them to collect data for weeks or even months before requiring a battery change.
* **Wearables:** Fitness trackers and smartwatches rely on optimizing power consumption to extend battery life for multiple days of use.
* **Automotive:** Electric vehicles use power management to optimize range and minimize energy consumption during various driving scenarios.
* **Industrial Automation:** Sensors and controllers in harsh environments benefit from power-saving features, extending the lifespan of equipment and reducing maintenance costs.
* **Aerospace:**  Critical systems in aircraft need reliable power, often with stringent power budgets.

**Connecting to Previous Chapters**

This chapter builds directly on your understanding of device driver architecture (Chapter 16) and core Zephyr concepts. You’ve learned how to interact with hardware using the Zephyr APIs, manage threads, and trace/log events. Power management leverages these skills by integrating them into the driver development lifecycle, specifically focusing on reducing power consumption and providing flexible system states.

**Motivation and Practical Applications**

By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to write drivers that intelligently manage power states, minimizing energy usage when the device is idle and seamlessly resuming operation when needed. This translates to longer battery life, reduced system heat, and improved overall system performance.



### 2. Theory (2850 words)

**System Power Management**

Zephyr’s system power management offers a hierarchical approach, starting with device-level control and extending to system-wide power states. The core concept is to define *power states* – different levels of system activity and associated power consumption.

* **Device Tree Definitions:**  Power states are defined within the device tree. The `power-states` section describes the available states. For example, `state0` represents a low-power "suspend-to-idle" state, while `state1` might support "suspend-to-ram" for faster wake-up.
* **State Transitions:** Drivers use the Zephyr APIs to transition between these states.
* **Min-Residency & Exit Latency:** `min-residency-us` sets the minimum time the device must remain in a state before it's allowed to transition to another. `exit-latency-us` specifies the time taken to exit a state, impacting wake-up responsiveness.
* **Configuration (`CONFIG_PM`):** The `CONFIG_PM` configuration option must be enabled to utilize the power management features.

**Device Power Management**

This module provides a framework for controlling power consumption at the device level. It includes:

* **`PM_DEVICE_ACTION_*` Enums:** These enumerations define the different actions a driver can perform.
* **`device_suspend_hw()` & `device_resume_hw()`:**  Hardware-specific suspend and resume functions.
* **`device_save_context()` & `device_restore_context()`:** Save and restore device-specific context information.
* **Runtime Power Management:** This is the primary mechanism for managing power states.

**Power Domains**

Power domains are groups of hardware components that share a power supply.  By controlling the power supply to a specific domain, you can reduce power consumption. Zephyr doesn't directly expose granular power domain control, but drivers can utilize the `device_suspend_hw()` and `device_resume_hw()` functions to manage power on a per-device basis.  This approach is often sufficient for achieving significant power savings.

**Runtime Power Management**

* **`pm_device_init_suspended(dev)`:** This function indicates to Zephyr that the device is already in a suspended state.  This is important for correct driver behavior.
* **`pm_device_runtime_enable(dev)`:** Enables runtime power management for the device. This function is essential to enable the device to participate in the power management system.
* **`pm_device_runtime_get(dev)` & `pm_device_runtime_put(dev)`:** These functions manage the device's usage count. When a device is accessed (e.g., through a thread), its usage count increases.  When the device is no longer in use, the usage count decreases, potentially triggering a suspension or power-off event.

**Example API Usage (Illustrative)**

```c
// Example: Suspending and Resuming a Device
void device_suspend(const struct device *dev) {
    // Save device state (e.g., configuration)
    device_save_context(dev);
    // Suspend hardware
    device_suspend_hw(dev);
}

void device_resume(const struct device *dev) {
    // Restore device state
    device_restore_context(dev);
    // Resume hardware
    device_resume_hw(dev);
}
```

### 3. Lab Exercise (2300 words)

**Lab Goal:** Create a driver that intelligently suspends and resumes based on device usage, demonstrating the core power management concepts.

**Project Setup**

1. Create a new Zephyr project using the Zephyr CLI:

    ```bash
    mkdir power-management-example
    cd power-management-example
    zephyr mkdir -p nrst boot zphyr-bin zphyr-elf util-bin util-elf
    ```

2. Add the following dependencies to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

    ```cmake
    zephyr_define_feature(PM)
    ```

3.  Create a `prj.conf` file with the following content:

    ```cfg
    # prj.conf
    CONFIG_PM=y
    CONFIG_PM_DEVICE=y
    CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME=y
    CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_SHELL=y
    CONFIG_PM_STATS=y
    ```

**Driver Implementation (power_management_example/src/power_management_example.c)**

```c
#include <zephyr/sys/util.h>
#include <zephyr/sys/printk.h>
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>

#include "power_management_example.h"

static int power_management_example_operation(const struct device *dev)
{
    int ret;

    ret = pm_device_runtime_get(dev);
    if (ret < 0) {
        printk("Error getting device: %d\n", ret);
        return ret;
    }

    // Simulate device usage (e.g., sending data, processing)
    printk("Device is active\n");
    k_msleep(1000); // Simulate work

    // Decrement usage count (potential suspension)
    printk("Device is idle\n");
    k_msleep(500);

    // Put device (decreases usage count, may suspend)
    return pm_device_runtime_put(dev);
}

// Initialization function
int power_management_example_init(const struct device *dev)
{
    int ret;

    // Mark device as suspended if physically suspended
    pm_device_init_suspended(dev);

    // Enable device runtime power management
    ret = pm_device_runtime_enable(dev);
    if ((ret < 0) && (ret != -ENOSYS)) {
        printk("Error enabling runtime power management: %d\n", ret);
        return ret;
    }

    printk("Power management enabled.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**Device Tree (power-management-example/src/power_management_example.h)**

```c
#define POWER_MANAGEMENT_EXAMPLE_DEVICE_ID "power-management-example"

#define POWER_MANAGEMENT_EXAMPLE_DEVICE_DATA \
    { .rx_callback = NULL, .tx_callback = NULL }
```

**Build Instructions**

```bash
west build -b xtensa_lautaro_pza_actel -s
```

**Testing**

1.  Connect your target device to your computer.
2.  Run the application:

    ```bash
    west run -b xtensa_lautaro_pza_actel
    ```

3.  Observe the console output.  You should see messages indicating device activity and potential suspension events.

**Verification Procedure:**

1.  **Console Logs:** Examine the console output.  Look for messages indicating the device is active and when it’s suspended.
2.  **Usage Count:** (Advanced)  You could add a counter to track the device's usage count and verify that it decrements when the device is idle.

**Extension Challenges:**

*   **Wakeup Source:** Integrate a GPIO wakeup source to trigger the device from a low-power state.
*   **Custom Power States:**  Define custom power states (e.g., "deep sleep") with specific configurations.
*   **Stats:** Enable PM stats to measure power consumption and effectiveness of the power management implementation.

**Troubleshooting Guide**

*   **No Output:**  Ensure the `CONFIG_PM` and `CONFIG_PM_DEVICE` features are enabled and the build is successful.
*   **Errors:**  Check the `prj.conf` file for correct configurations.  Use `west build` to identify build errors.
*   **Device Not Suspending:** Verify that the device driver is properly implemented and the hardware is compatible with power management.
