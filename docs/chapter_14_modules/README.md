## Building on Interrupts and System Architecture

Having mastered interrupt management in Chapter 13—handling external hardware events and deferring processing using workqueues—you now understand how to build responsive, event-driven embedded systems. Your applications can react to the physical world in real-time, integrating asynchronous events into your structured software architecture.

However, as your applications grow in complexity, managing all your code within a single, monolithic structure becomes inefficient, difficult to maintain, and hard to scale. To build professional, production-grade embedded systems, you need a way to organize your code into reusable, independent, and configurable components. **Modules** provide the solution.

## Introduction

Modules are the key to building scalable, maintainable, and reusable firmware with Zephyr. They allow you to encapsulate related functionality—drivers, libraries, subsystems—into self-contained units that can be easily integrated into any Zephyr application. This modular approach is fundamental to modern software engineering and is essential for managing the complexity of today's embedded systems.

**Why are Modules Critical?**

- **Reusability:** Write a module once (e.g., for a specific sensor or communication protocol) and reuse it across multiple projects, saving significant development time.
- **Maintainability:** Isolate functionality within a module. Bug fixes or feature updates in one module are less likely to break other parts of your application.
- **Scalability:** Easily add or remove features from your application by simply including or excluding the corresponding modules.
- **Collaboration:** Teams can work on different modules in parallel, improving development velocity.

**Real-World Scenarios:**

- **Sensor Libraries:** A company develops a proprietary sensor. They can create a Zephyr module containing the sensor's driver and processing library, which can then be easily distributed to customers to integrate into their own Zephyr applications.
- **Communication Stacks:** A team building an IoT product might create separate modules for their Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular communication stacks, allowing them to easily create product variants with different connectivity options.
- **Motor Control:** In a robotics project, the motor control system, including drivers and control algorithms, can be encapsulated in a module, allowing it to be reused in different robots.

This chapter builds upon your knowledge of the Zephyr build system (Chapter 3), Kconfig (Chapter 4), and West (Chapter 5). You will learn how to structure a module, write the necessary `CMakeLists.txt` and `Kconfig` files, and integrate it into your application using the West manifest. Mastering modules will elevate your Zephyr skills, enabling you to create truly professional and scalable embedded systems.
