## Building on Configuration and Modular Design

Having mastered Kconfig symbols in Chapter 15—creating configurable, adaptable modules that can be customized for different deployment scenarios—you now understand how to build professional embedded software architectures. However, the most sophisticated modular designs and configuration systems are meaningless without robust interfaces to the underlying hardware that powers your embedded systems.

Device driver architecture represents the critical foundation layer that connects your well-architected, configurable software modules to the physical hardware they control. This chapter teaches you to create the hardware abstraction layer that makes your modular architectures truly powerful and hardware-independent.

## Introduction

Device driver architecture forms the essential bridge between your sophisticated software designs and the physical hardware they control. Building upon your modular architecture and configuration expertise, device drivers provide the standardized interfaces that make your embedded systems portable, maintainable, and professional-grade.
