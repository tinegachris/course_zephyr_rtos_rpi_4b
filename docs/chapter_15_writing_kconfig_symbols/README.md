## Building on Modular Architecture Foundations

Having mastered modular architecture in Chapter 14—organizing complex embedded systems into manageable, reusable components—you now understand how to structure sophisticated applications that integrate threading, communication, security, and hardware management. However, creating truly professional modules requires more than just code organization; you need a systematic way to make your modules **configurable** and **adaptable** to different deployment scenarios.

Kconfig symbols provide the configuration backbone that transforms your well-architected modules into flexible, reusable components that can be customized for different hardware platforms, performance requirements, and application needs without modifying the underlying code.

## Introduction

This chapter delves into the creation and use of Kconfig symbols—the configuration system that makes your modular architectures truly professional and deployable. Building directly upon the modular design principles you've mastered, Kconfig symbols provide the mechanism by which users can customize and configure your modules for their specific requirements.
